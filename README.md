# ðŸ“¦ Shipment Report Automation API

This is a FastAPI-based project for generating enriched shipment reports using data from TMS, Windward, and weather services. It includes an AI model to detect whether a shipment delay is weather-related.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-project-folder>
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Make sure you have **Python 3.8+** installed.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, you can install dependencies manually:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn transformers pandas
```

### 3. Run the server

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

> Replace `main` with the name of your Python file (e.g. `app.py`, `server.py`) if it's different.
